# Based on: https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/02-starting-with-data.html



# Lets download some data (make sure the data folder exists)
download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")

# now we will read this "csv" into an R object called "surveys"
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")

# and take a look at it
surveys
head(surveys)
View(surveys)


# BTW, we assumed our data was comma separated, however this might not
# always be the case. So we may been to tell read.csv more about our file.



# So what kind of an R object is "surveys" ?
class(surveys)



# ok - so what are dataframes ?
str(surveys)
dim(surveys)
nrow(surveys)
ncol(surveys)

head(surveys,2)
tail(surveys,2)

names(surveys)
rownames(surveys)

summary(surveys)

# --------
# Exercise
# --------
#
# What is the class of the object surveys?
#
# Answer:


# How many rows and how many columns are in this survey ?
#
# Answer:

# What's the average weight of survey animals
#
#
# Answer:
42.67

# Are there more Birds than Rodents ?
#
#
# Answer:
No

# 
# Topic: Sub-setting
#

# first element in the first column of the data frame (as a vector)
surveys[1,1]

# first element in the 6th column (as a vector)
surveys[1,6]

# first column of the data frame (as a vector)
surveys[,6]

# first column of the data frame (as a data frame)


# first row (as a data frame)


# first three elements in the 7th column (as a vector)


# the 3rd row of the data frame (as a data.frame)


# equivalent to head(metadata)


# looking at the 1:6 more closely


# we also use other objects to specify the range



#
# Challenge: Using slicing, see if you can produce the same result as:
#
#   tail(surveys)
#
# i.e., print just last 6 rows of the surveys dataframe
#
# Solution:



# We can omit (leave out) columns using '-'



# column "names" can be used in place of the column numbers



#
# Topic: Factors (for categorical data)
#


# factors have an order


# Converting factors


# can be tricky if the levels are numbers


# so does our survey data have any factors


#
# Topic:  Dealing with Dates
#

# R has a whole library for dealing with dates ...



# R can concatenated things together using paste()


# 'sep' indicates the character to use to separate each component


# paste() also works for entire columns


# let's save the dates in a new column of our dataframe surveys$date 


# and ask summary() to summarise 


# but what about the "Warning: 129 failed to parse"
